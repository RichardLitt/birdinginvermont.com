One of the most common and easiest birds to identify in the Northeast, our White-breasted Nuthatch is known for visiting bird-feeders, walking upside-down down trees, storing seeds away from the feeder, and it's peculiar _yank_ call.

This _yank_ makes the White-breasted Nuthatch one of the easiest birds to identify down to the subspecies level. eBird groups the eleven subspecies into three groupings: here, in Vermont, we have a single common species, the nominate _Sitta carolinensis carolinensis_. It alone of the subspecies emits this call. An example of this nasal, polyphonic call can be heard [here](https://macaulaylibrary.org/audio/107225).

There are other ways to identify the Eastern White-breasted Nuthatch.

Birds of the World (Grubb and Pravosudov 2020) says:

> Birds in the eastern United States and Canada utter a nasal yenk... Bill stout, blunt; ventrum white; dorsum pale blue-gray.

Generally, these are good differentiators.

The dorsum is particularly marked compared to western subspecies, which are darker. It should be noted that dorsum color is also used to sex White-breasted Nuthatches, with pale-crowned birds generally being considered female. However, Wood (1993) shows that "determining the sex of birds in the field at a distance is considerably more difficult. East of the Great Plains, at least 10% of all females regardless of population have little enough gray in the crown to be easily mistaken for males." (This is much more difficult in the southern regions of their range, such as in Florida). This means that dorsum color should not be used as the only justification for subspecies identification.

To date, there are no records of other subspecies in Vermont.
