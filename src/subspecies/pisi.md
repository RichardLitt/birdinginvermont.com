Pine Siskins are either an infrequent or a frequent bird in Vermont, depending on the year and their irruptive patterns. For instance, there were only scattered records for the first half of 2020, but, in the autumn, they were a frequent feature around the state.

There are three, and possibly four, subspecies. Differences between them are mostly "weak and clinal" (Pyle 1997), with the exception of one of the Mexican subspecies, _Spinus pinus perplexus_ (which isn't very perplexing, at all). In Vermont, the common subspecies is most likely the nominate one, although individual variation may obscure possible _vagans_ vagrants from the mid-West. In any event, Cornell only recognizes two subspecies groups on eBird: the Northern and the Chiapas groupings. Separating the two is rather simple.

Birds of the World (Dawson 2020) says:

> S. p. perplexus (van Rossem, 1938). Resident in highlands of s. Chiapas and w. Guatemala [type locality = San Andr√©s, Chiapas]. Somewhat resembles S. p. pinus but ventral streaks are diffuse, secondary bar narrow, and superciliary line gray; averages smaller than even the nominate subspecies. This subspecies is sufficiently distinct in appearance from other taxa of S. pinus that studies are needed to clarify its taxonomic status (Howell and Webb 1995).

Pyle (1997) doesn't differentiate the Mexican subspecies, as his book is largely concerned with American birds. However, he does mention that it can be difficult to separate from Eurasian Siskin when there is a green morph.

The narrow secondary bar may be difficult to tell except in flight.

To date, there are no records on eBird of other subspecies in Vermont. The [record listed](https://ebird.org/checklist/S74931206) when this page was created was the first record of the Northern Pine Siskin in Vermont with media.
