# Terms and Conditions

We currently store none of your data. We do not save your eBird data if you upload it; all work is done through your browser, and there is no server where information is held.

The taxonomy and some records have come from eBird. The VBRC records were provided by VCE (thank you!).

We do not currently track any user data on this website.

All work is provided free of charge. Get in touch if you need to cite this work for any reason.

Finally, if you're interested in funding this research, do get in touch. Ultimately, this is a hobby, but there's no reason I couldn't do this sustainably forever if I were in funds.
