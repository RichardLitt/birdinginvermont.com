            <p style={{backgroundColor:"#FFFF00"}}><b>Notice:</b> This site is a work in construction. Eventually, we'll have a nice landing page.</p>
            <p>For now, there are a few things we have here. First, <b>the map below</b> can be populated with <a href="https://ebird.org/downloadMyData">your eBird data</a> to show you what species you've seen in each town in Vermont. You can also upload your data regarding your photo or audio submissions to the Macaulay library. The <b>Biophysical Regions</b> tabs shows you what you've sene in each region of Vermont. Clicking and unclicking on a town once you've loaded your data allows you to move your mouse and look around some more.</p>
            <p>The <b>Subspecies</b> page is in active development, too, but will eventually show you information on the birds in Vermont that have interesting subspecies. For now, they'll likely be updated frequently one at a time.</p>
            <p>The <b>NFCs</b> page is for information related to Nocturnal Flight Calls, and species research there.</p>
            <p>The <b>Rarities</b> page will check your eBird records from 2020 for rare birds that should be submitted to the Vermont Birds Records Committee.</p>
