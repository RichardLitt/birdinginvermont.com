# NFCs: Pine Siskin

<iframe width="640" height="518" src="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/271711911/embed/640" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="width:6040px;max-width:100%;"></iframe>

Pine Siskins, an irruptive finch whose populations and migrations depend on pine cone crop, are a common fixture across Vermont, especially in some winters. While not traditionally considered a nocturnal migrant (Evans and O'Brien 2002), they have been known to migrate at night (Watson, Wells and Bavis 2011, Mandelbaum 2020).

Pine Siskins give a variety of flight calls: a _zweew_, somewhat like their rising idiosyncratic _zree_ zipper calls; and a Goldfinch-esque flight call, described as _jirp jirp jirp_ or _chu-tu-tu-tu_; and _zree_ or _waaaee_ calls, _chit_ calls, and _klee-you_ calls (Evans and O'Brien 2002, Pieplow 2017). Choosing which call is most relevant for a given recording can be difficult, as can be disambiguating calls from other species.

> Determination of exact number is difficult because of apparent variation in phonetic rendition among observers. Like other carduelines, frequently gives flight calls. Calls of this species are generally characterized in terms such as “rasping” and “throaty” (Dawson 1923)...

Unfortunately, this species' repertoire is extremely similar to both Redpolls and both Goldfinches. I struggled to find a single way of telling them apart reliably by looking at the spectrogram, for any of the published records of these calls. The _klee-you_ described by Evans and O'Brien (2002) appears to be idiosyncratic; but the _zree_ calls can be easily confused, and the _jirp jirp_ flight calls are not plastic, while Redpoll calls are extremely plastic, making sure identifcation difficult.

For this species, I would strongly encourage discretion for identifying the species, and reliance upon both finch irruption charts during the recording time (how likely is it that it could be a Hoary Redpoll? Luckily, most likely not very, especially in Vermont) and close listening to the recording itself, judging the raspy nature of the Pine Siskin. Many calls may be best left unidentified.

### Published References

Watson, Wells and Bavis (2011) first logged recording NFCs for Siskins, using only the _kdeew_ call:

> Flight calls ... we considered to be of Pine Siskins ... were identical to the well-known and described ‘‘Kdeew’’ flight call of the species (Sibley 2000).

Pieplow (2017) describes several calls, given diurnally:

> Zree - Rising, polyphonic. Zweew - Overslurred, slightly burry. [Both] all year. Zree possible in alarm; Zweew, posibly a variat of Zree, often with Flight Call.

And:

> Flight Call: _Jirp jirp jirp_. All year, in contact and flight. Only slightly variable. Lower, less musical than Lesser Goldfinch Flight Call. ... Polyphonic, slightly noisy notes in series.

Evans and O'Brien (2002) give four possible NFC calls, but note that it is not known to give flight all nocturnally. This may have changed in the past two decades. The calls given are:

> A quick, harsh "chu-tu-tu-tu", a strident, emphatic "klee-you", and a rising, nasal "waaaee" are the most common flight calls.  Also gives a short "chit". Occasionally given in flight, but more typically from a treetop, is a long, rising, buzzy "zreeeeeeee".

Sanders (2013) notes a "distinctive low double peak", and shows a spectrogram of a Pine Siskin, which doesn't match any other records I could find.

### Example Calls

[This](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/106620) is a fairly good _zree_ example, from the main eBird page. [This](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/56187511) is presumably the disjointed song mentioned by Pieplow (2017), which may also be the _klee-you_ of Evans and O'Brien (2002). [Here](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/102214701) is a good example of the flight call.

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- None. Listen to the call, and leave outliers unidentified.

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

All of the Pine Siskin and their associates calls are confusing to track down and compare due to phonetic differences. I have done my best.

#### _Zree_ call

The Zree call, a rising polyphonic _zeep_, is one of the most characteristic calls of this species, but easily confused with some calls from other birds. Dawson (2020) notes:

> A grating call with rising inflection is one of the most familiar sounds produced by Pine Siskins. This “watch-winding” note— zree-e-e-e-e-eet, zwee-e-eeet, shr-reet, sooeet, or possibly a husky chee-ee, depending on author—may also serve as flight call or be uttered before or after completion of flight. This call, also described as züm or zzeem, is always accompanied (presumably in perching individuals) by the display of hidden yellow markings in the wings and tail, according to Dawson (Dawson 1923).

This call is described as being similar to:

##### Brewer's Blackbird (Pieplow 2017)

The Songlike call of the Brewer's Blackbird which most resembles a _zree_ is noted as having an "odd whiny quality" and a "polyphonic upslur". The call shown in Pieplow (2017) has only a handful of bands, and looks much less turbulent than the Pine Siskin _zree_. It is unclear when this call would be given, as the more detailed page in Martin (2020) lacks the same phonetic representation as Pieplow (2017) (a rather annoyingly common problem for this species).

This bird is a rare vagrant to Vermont, and it seems unlikely this call would be given or used during NFCs. Evans and O'Brien (2002) give "an abrupt, dry, wooden 'tjek'" as the main NFC call, which means that diurnal similarity notwithstanding, this call and bird can probably be excluded from the list of similar suspects.

##### Common Redpoll (Evans and O'Brien 2002, Pieplow 2017)

The spectrograms in Pieplow (2017) look rather similar to the Pine Siskin. However, the bands all appear to rise together, and it is generally only 300mS in length, as opposed to the Siskin's 500mS. The band as well has a slight bump in the first 50mS or so, where it almost has a downturn effect. Looking at the spectrogram should be enough to disambiguate this species.

Evans and O'Brien (2002)'s call has the same feature, for their _duraaai_ call.

Of course, if the _zree_ is simply a poor variant of the more common _zhree_ zipper call, than there may be intergrades between _zree_ and _zhree_ which appear to be similar to Redpolls. I don't have evidence to back any of this conjecture up.

##### Hoary Redpoll (Evans and O'Brien 2002, Pieplow 2017)

The Hoary Redpoll looks similar to the Common Redpoll; however, the bands are somewhat more irregular, although still rising and rarely crossing (if ever). The same bump as in the Common Redpoll is notable in the first 30mS. (Pieplow 2017)

However, the _draaai_ call shown in Evans and O'Brien (2002), from Gunn (1958), although noted as "fairly atypical", is much more erratic, with crossing bands, and looks, to me, almost indistinguishable from a Siskin. It still has the slight bump in the beginning, which is not typical of the Pine Siskin. Evans and O'Brien (2002) note:

> "Draaai" call distinctive. It is more pure-toned and more evenly rising than Common's "duraaai", without the complex dip at the beginning.

##### American Goldfinch (Evans and O'Brien 2002, Pieplow 2017, possibly Godfrey 1986)

Pieplow considers that the _Zree_ is similar to the Pine Siskin, but notes that the _Zree_ is "high, clear, long" for the American Goldfinch, but "Medium-high, fairly long" for the Pine Siskin. Outside of specific measurements, these relative statements have little meaning. (The Lesser Goldfich and House Finch are "medium-low, long" and "medium-low, short, almost a _Zreet_", respectively.) Dawson quotes Godfrey in saying that the call of the Pine Siskin is:

> “harsher than similar calls of redpolls” and “huskier and more buzzy than the song of the American Goldfinch, which it resembles somewhat” (Godfrey 1986: 570).

Here, we assume they mean the _zree_ call. It seems unlikely that the song would be given during nocturnal or redetermined migration.

Evans and O'Brien (2002) note that "_Wuwuiii_ call particularly similar to redpolls and Pine Siskin but higher and more wavering."

Looking directly at the spectrograms (specifically, those in Pieplow 2017), it is difficult to see a clear differentiation. The American Goldfinch has less formants (or bands), and they appear to be more unidirectionally sloping upwards, while the Pine Siskin's tend to go every which way, and there are slightly more. However, this may be an artefact of the recordings used, and will certainly be difficult to tell from a poor recording of a _Zree_, as often occur in NFCs, when the bird may be far away or the climate may not be conducive for sound propagation. Length appears identical, and both appear to range from around 2kHz to 10kHz (and perhaps higher, as 10kHz isn't necessarily the cutoff for passerine calls).

Listening, here and if possible, may be the best way to tell the husky or buzzy call of the Siskin from the Goldfinch. However, the American Goldfinch _zree_ is noted as being "in alarm," while, for the Pine Siskin, this is noted as "possible", and elsewhere it is noted as being part of a display call, where the yellow feathers are shown (Dawson 2020). Thus, an NFC that has a _Zree_ call in it _may_ more likely be a Siskin, as their calls _may_ be more plastic.

Pine Siskins are possibly part of a superspecies with American Goldfinches, systematically (Dawson 2020, quoting Am. Ornithol. Union 1998), so confusion here could perhaps be excused. For this particular call, discretion is obviously advised, and may be the better part of the valorous identification.

#### _Jirp jirp jirp_ calls

The _jirp_ flight calls are grouped by Pieplow (2017) with all of the other finches, which includes Red Crossbill, Lesser and American Goldfinch, Olive-sided Flycatcher, both Redpolls, and White-Winged Crossbills. Knowing whether a call is a _jirp_ or a _jit_ is difficult in the field. For this call, listening to the sound itself may again be the best diagnostic, as opposed to using the spectrogram. For the _jirp_ calls, Pieplow (2017) lists the Redpolls as being similar, while also noting explicitely that it is "lower, less musical than Lesser Goldfinch Flight Call."

This call is probably the _chu-tu-tu-tu_ call of Evans and O'Brien (2002).

Both the Common and Hoary Redpoll are noted as having calls that are "hugely variable" by Pieplow (2017). Given the spectrograms in Pieplow (2017) and Evans and O'Brien (2002), I can't think of a reliable way to disambiguate these by sight. Discretion is again advised.

#### _Zweew_ call (Pieplow 2017)

The _zweew_ call, described as "like a seminasal _Weew_ ... but polyphonic", could be given by any of five species: however, only PISI is noted as being _rather high, clear._ The other four species - Black-headed Grosbeak, House Finch, House Sparrow, and Eurasian Tree Sparrow, are "lower, slightly harsher". On the spectrogram, the last three are similar in range of frequencies, although they are somewhat burrier in construction - meaning, having less clear bands, and more frication throughout the call.

It is unclear if this call is referenced by others, again due to differences in phonetic representation of bird calls.

#### _Klee-you_ calls (Evans and O'Brien 2002)

No listed confounding calls from other species. Possibly the _Zweew_ call of Pieplow (2017).

#### _Chit_ calls (Evans and O'Brien 2002)

No listed confounding calls from other species. Rarer call.
