# NFCs: Dunlin

The Dunlin is a small shorebird that comes through Vermont regularly on migration, but is rarely seen outside of the Champlain and Connecticut River valleys. Its nocturnal flight call is generally distinctive. While there is no direct reference that states which call is the nocturnal flight call, the flight call during the day is almost invariably described as a raspy _kreep_-like sound, and there are few possible confusing species that would give a similar call at night.

### Published References

Birds of the World (Warnock and Gill 2020) references Cramp and Simmons 1983, saying:

> When flushed, flying, or departing for migration, birds often give a distinctive krree call (NDW); chrri, cheerp, treer, or treep (Cramp and Simmons 1983).

Holden and Housden (2009):

> Usual flight call is rough 'treep'.

Svensson, Grant, Mullarney, and Zetterström (1999):

> Voice: Flight-call a buzzing or harshly rolling 'chrrreet'.

Sibley (2016):

> Flight call distinctive, buzzy, rasping _pjeeve_.

Garcia-del-Rey (2011):

> Most characteristic flight-call when flushed is a rasping, shril "kreep".

Paulson (1993):

> The flight call is a rasping _cheeezp_, fairly loud and far carrying. Of regional shorebirds, this call is most like the Western Sandpiper's call but more raspy. Birds often sing a rhythmically pulsed buzzy song in spring migration.

Dunne (2006):

> Call is a short, high-pitched, breathy trill. Feeding birds make a sound that recalls the soft "chur" of bluebirds. Also makes a mellow and high-pitched "peep".

Pieplow (2017) notes:

> Grate: distinctively screechy, often slightly downslurred... given in flight or alarm; classic version is quite distinctive, long and scratchy. ... All calls are exceedingly plastic; excited flocks make many sounds, from single peeps to short trilled or noisy notes. Song sometimes given in migration.

Pieplow notes that the "High, fine, almost screeching" Grate is similar to Black Tern, Wilson's Plover, or Red Phalarope. The "High, coarse" and "Medium pitch" Grates have six and nine species, respectively, too, so noting screechiness and frequency is important for identifying this species.

Dunlins are known to call more frequently near shore in nocturnal migration (Welcker and Vilela 2018), which may mean that it is easier to pick them up in central Vermont than over Lake Champlain. Welcker and Vilela (2018) also note that:

> Although Dunlins and Common Sandpipers migrate primarily during the night they are thought to usually fly at high altitudes outside the range of acoustic recordings at sea (Green 2004).

However, Green is not in their references.

### Call Description

Looking at the spectrograms given in Pieplow (2017) and on XenoCanto, it seems clear that the Dunlin's call is:

- Generally between 2-4kHz
- Occasionally downslurred, but often level
- Around 1-300mS in length, for each utterance
- Often given in a short series (although potentially not as an NFC)
- Somewhat raspy in nature

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- Raspy
- Between 2kHz and 4kHz, generally, by looking at spectrograms in Pieplow (2017)
- Possibly downslurred (Pieplow 2017)

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

In general, almost none of these calls is possibly to be confused with the Dunlin _by night_; during the day, birds give more calls which are possibly confusing.

##### Black Tern (Pieplow 2017)

The Black Tern's Grate can be similar; however, this call is mostly given during aggression (Pieplow 2017), and from the examples in Pieplow, it tends to be much more widely spread across the frequency range, from 1-8khz, and it can appear to by polyphonic. A glance at the spectrogram should eliminate this rare species (especially in Vermont).

##### Wilson's Plover (Pieplow 2017)

Range and polyphonicity with a rising curve eliminate this species; looking at the spectrogram, it would be very hard to misidentify a Dunlin as a WIPL.

##### Red Phalarope (Pieplow 2017)

The Red Phalarope gives it grate in altercations, while its peep call is the most common in migration and winter. As well, the Grate call is polyphonic, and normally has a humped shape.

##### Western Sandpiper (Paulson 1993)

The Western Sandpiper has "high, brief, burry, often downslurred" cheep calls (Pieplow 2017). Looking at the spectrograms given in Pieplow (2017), it appears to have each call at around 100mS in length maximum, compared to the Dunlin's regularly being 2-300mS. As well, the main band is often above 5kHz, which is higher than a Dunlin.

##### Eastern Bluebird (Dunne 2006)

Bluebirds give a distinctive NFCs call, "typically a low, mellow, two-syllabled "pya-der". Less often a shorter, one syllable "pya"." (Evans and O'Brien 2002). This call is unlikely to be confused with the raspy call of the Dunlin during NFCs, although the Bluebird's _churr_ might be confusing during the day.
