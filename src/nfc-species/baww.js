# NFCs: Black-and-white Warbler

The Black-and-white Warbler has a distinctive and, most often, an easily recognizable NFC. All of the following information refers to the _dzit_ or _dzinn_ call. This call is given both diurnally and nocturnally (Evans 2002, Pieplow 2017, Kricher 2020).

### Published References

Pieplow (2017) identifies it as a "Dzit", noting:

> Very short, very high buzzy note. Shorter and usually finer than Burry Seet. {The BAWW's is} often rising; see Sreet, p.501.

> Dzit... rising or monotone. ... given all year, often in flight, including by night migrants.

Evans (2002) notes:

> A delicate "dzinn" with a fine sibilant buzz, often slightly rising. Many calls have a subtle two-parted character, while others are nearly monotone.

> Most similar to Blue-winged and Golden-winged Warblers but the subtle two-parted character is usually distinctive. Also compare to Chestnut-sided Warbler.

> **Spectrographic description:** Measured calls (N=13) were 56-87.5 (68.3) mS in duration and in the 6.6-10.8 (7.2-9.3) kHz frequency range. The frequency track was single or double-banded, typically with an initial relatively short section of descent followed by a longer variably rising and downward-arched section. It was modulated with a spacing of 3.5-4.1 (3.8) mS between humps and a depth of 0.7-1.2 (1) kHz.

Birds of the World notes (Kricher 2020):

> Call note is a sharp chip or pit, similar to that of Blackpoll Warbler (Griscom and Sprunt 1957, Terres 1980b), with many variations (Allison in Bent 1953b). During breeding, females call when close to mate and away from nest. Paired males also call sometimes, probably to keep in contact with female. On wintering grounds, call note is a thin, weak tsit or tseep, reportedly difficult for humans to hear (Stiles and Skutch 1989).

It is unclear to me wehterh the tsit or tseep described in Stiles and Skutch (1989) is different from the chip or pit calls. There is no mention of NFCs in BotW.

### Salient points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- Two parted (rules out NOWA, LOWA, KEWA, CSWA)
  - If two-partedness does not involve tail, rules out BWWA
  - If two-partedness does not include modulation changes, rules out GWWA
- Wavelength under 4.1mS (rules out NOWA, LOWA, KEWA, CSWA)
- More than 10 waves (rules out NOWA, LOWA, BLPW, KEWA)

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

  - LOWA has almost identical depth to BAWW (Evans 2002)
  - LOWA has an average of 4.5 humps (Evans 2002), to the BAWW's 20 or so (No citation)
- Kentucky Warbler (Pieplow)
  - Single banded (Evans 2002)

  - Depth averages lower, not larger than 860kHz (Evans 2002)
- Golden-winged Warbler (Evans)
  - Can be two parted, but this was due to a switch in modulation from a spacing of 3.7mS, depth 250kHz to 7mS, depth 920kHz. (Evans 2002)
  - GWWA call not longer than 64mS (Evans 2002), so some overlap for short calls, but not for longer ones.
