The Canada Warbler has a distinctive NFC call. Pieplow (2017) notes three different types of calls: the _tswit_, _tink_, and _chip_ call. The NFC call most easily identified is the _tswit_ flight call, also called a _pcht_ call by Evans (2002), or a _zzee_ call by Reitsma et al. (2020).

The _twsit_ call is given in flight both diurnally and nocturnally, making analysis relatively straightforward.

However, it is difficult to rule out other calls, especially for calls which aren't very clear or regular. At least one salient feature can be used to eliminate all other species - the initial dip in the inverted V - but multiple features will need to be taken into account simultaneously to come to a solid identification.

### Published References

Pieplow (2017) identifies the _twsit_ call as follows:

> All year, often in flight. Quite variable in pitch and length.

This _twsit_ call is described generically, along with the Wilson's Warbler, in the guide at the end of the book (pg. 499) like this:

> Like _Sreet_, but with stronger consonant sound at start; generally lower, sharper, and more Chiplike. See Tseet, which is slightly longer.

Neither the _Sreet_ or _Tseet_ calls give a reference to the Canada Warbler, and their spectrograms are slightly different. The _tink_ and _chip_ calls for CAWA have different frequencies: _tinks_ are between 8-10kHz, _chips_ are much shorter and run from 3-10kHz. It's probably safe to assume that the _tswit_ is the NFC given by Evans (2002) as the main examplar of a CAWA NFC.

Evans (2002) writes:

> An abrupt, liquid "pcht". Sometimes a buzzier "pzch".

And describes it like this:

> Measured calls (N=8) were 33.5-66.5 (42.2) mS in duration and in the 2.7-9.2 (3.2-7.8) kHz frequency range. The frequency track was single-banded and began with a steep descent from about 7-8 kHz to a low point of about 3-4 kHz (where the track was often faint or partially broken) followed by an equally steep rise back above 6 kHz where a brief and variable modulated section followed. The modulated section usually consisted of 1-3 humps with a spacing of 7.7-10.3 (9) mS and a depth of 1-1.8 (1.5) kHz.

He also notes that it sounds similar to Wilson's Warbler, and it can be similar to Common Yellowthroat.

Birds of the World (Reitsma et al. 2020) notes:

> a high-pitched _zzee_ in flight

They cite three different publications (Eaton (1914), Clement and Gunn (1957), and Curson, Quinn and Beadle (1994)) to back this up, but don't refer to the _zzee_ again in the documentation, and never mention nocturnal flight calls or migration sounds.

Sibley (2016) notes:

> Flight call a sharp, smacking, upslurred _chwit_.

### Example Calls

A good call that involves a bird which was seen, recorded, and commented upon in the checklist is here: https://ebird.org/checklist/S29816506. This clip has multiple _tswit_ calls in it.

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- Initial inverted V is unique to CAWA.
- Length can be used to rule out WIWA, if longer than 40mS
- Modular section should only be up to three humps. More than that, and it is likely to be a COYE abberant call.
- A deeper trough than 3.4kHz can rule out WIWA and COYE.

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

All notes for species are coming from Evans (2002), unless where noted.

The most similar species is the sister species _Cardellina pusilla_, or Wilson's Warbler, and the more distantly related Common Yellowthroat.

##### Wilson's Warbler (Evans 2002, Pieplow 2017)

Evans (2002) notes here are based on five samples, which may be a small sample size for analysis.

- **Duration:** Shorter, at 15.9-37.5 (27.5) mS. Some overlapping on the longer end.
- **Regularity:** "An initial steeply rising section followed by an equally steep descending section creating an inverted "V". In some cases there was an additional variable rising section. Presumed Wilson's nocturnal calls were typically longer and more often showed a rising section at the end of the call." (Evans 2002). Note that this lacks the initial dip of a CAWA.
- **Directionality:** Variable.
- **Bandedness:** Single or partially double.
- **Frequency range:** 4.4-8.8 (5.4-7.9) kHz. CAWA can be deeper than this.
- **Wavelength:** Not modulated.
- **Number of waves:** Not modulated.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Gives flight calls either by day or night.

##### Common Yellowthroat (Evans 2002)

This rests on the assumption that some COYE calls lack modulation. These calls are generally short and rising, which can look like a short CAWA call without a clear downslope in the initial dip. Most COYE calls are easy to rule out; instead, this information should be used for calls which aren't particularly strong candidates for CAWA.

- **Duration:** Almost identical, although the lower bound is 45 mS, whereas it is 33mS with CAWA.
- **Regularity:** Rising and then stable, if not modulated (in which case it is often stable). Lacking initial dip.
- **Directionality:** Rising.
- **Bandedness:** Single or double.
- **Frequency range:** 3.4-9.5kHz
- **Wavelength:** If there is modularity (as is usual), this rules out a CAWA.
- **Number of waves:** See above.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** The non-modulated calls are presumed to be COYE. These haven't been recorded during the day, as far as I know now.
