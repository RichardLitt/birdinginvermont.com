# NFCs: Spotted Sandpiper

<iframe width="640" height="518" src="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/242447541/embed/640" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="width:6040px;max-width:100%;"></iframe>

The Spotted Sandpiper is a common shorebird in Vermont, both in the Champlain basin and further inland. It is also a commonly nocturnal migrant, being quite vocal in flight and easily identifiable as a peep species. Disambiguating it from Solitary Sandpiper is the main challenge for identifying this species. Many birds would be best left unidentified. Luckily, the night calls are almost identical to the day-time flight calls for this species.

### Published References

Pieplow (2017) notes two calls given during migration: the _pee-pwee-pwee_ and the shorter _pee_ call. The _pee-pwee-pwee_ has:

> 2 upslurred whistles, second slightly lower. ... Longer versoin: First 1-3 notes shorter, higher.

He notes:

> Given all year, in alarm and in flight, including nocturnal migration; 2-note version most common, especially from ground. Longer version sometimes very long, sound like (and prehaps grading into) Song. Lower and slower than Solitary Sandpiper _Pwee-pwee-pwee_, with series almost always downslurred.

The _pee_ series, he notes:

> 2-4 high short monotone whistles.. Longer than Pips and usually given in shorter series... Given by birds in flight at any time of year, including during sustained migration (dya or night).

Sibley (2016) describes Solitary as "higher and more urgent" than Spotted:

> Flight call a high, clear, whistled series _peet weet weet_ lazier and lower-pitched than Solitary.

Birds of the World (Reed 2020) doesn't cover nocturnal flight calls in depth:

> Consist of _weet weet_ and _peet peet peet_ and are given on the ground or in flight.

Clarfield has also heard Solitary described as "tinnier" or "hollower". (Clarfield, personal communications)

### Call Description

Call assessments eyeballed from Pieplow (2017). There are several different types of NFC call, also given diurnally. The _pee_ series are flat, or form small inverted u's, and are not easily confused. However, the _pee-pwee-pwee_ series is shaped similarly, with up-ticks. This is used for the information below. Note that this information has a sample size of 2.

- **Duration:** 20mS per call, 2-5 calls per second
- **Regularity:** The notes are slightly different. See below.
- **Directionality:** Short version has 2 upslurred notes, with the second slightly lower. The longer version has the first 1-3 notes shorter, higher, with the ascent looking like a hockey-stick and not consistent. Beginning notes tend to have a short quick ascent, of around .5kHz depth, and can have a short tail of around .3kHz depth.
- **Depth**: Whistle depth is generally 1-2kHz.
- **Bandedness:** Single.
- **Frequency range:** 3-5kHz.
- **Wavelength:** Not modulated.
- **Number of waves:** Not modulated.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.

### Example Calls

The eBird _pee-pwee-pwee_ call example is [here](https://macaulaylibrary.org/audio/132195), which is the two-noted call. A good example of the longer flight call is [this one](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/111603051), which shows more of a variable nature for the calls.

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- Higher than Upland Sandpiper
- Each call generally of the same size, unlike Killdeer
- Calls slightly lower than Solitary Sandpiper, without tail or sharp ascender
- Solitary Sandpiper calls are more regular and similar than Spotted
- Longer Spotted Sandpiper calls have more spacing between the calls

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

Pieplow (2017) notes at the back that the Spotted Sandpiper has a three-parted call, and he gives examples of other birds with the same format, noting Verdin, Olive-sided Flycatcher song, American Oystercatcher Pittiweew, and the Killdeer Dee-dit-dit. Verdin and Olive-sided Flycatchers aren't worth going into here, due to range and lack of night song during migration, respectively. American Oystercatcher can be disambiguated easily: It has a long overslurred whistle as its third call. For the upslurred call, he also lists Baird's Sandpiper, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and Prothonotary Warbler song - all of which can be discarded as based on a typical Spotted Sandpiper call comparison by looking at the length of the calls, for Baird's, and the time of night and location, for the other two. This leaves the Killdeer and the Solitary Sandpiper as main contenders for confusion.

I think another confusing bird would be Upland Sandpiper, which has a similar, if lower, call.

##### Solitary Sandpiper

The _pwee-pwee-pwee_ call is identified as an NFC call by Pieplow (2017).  Note that this information has a sample size of 2. Call assessments eyeballed from Pieplow (2017).

- **Duration:** 60mS
- **Regularity:** Notes normally on same pitch, although last note can be shorter.
- **Directionality:** Ascending like an exponential curve, with a sharp tail of .5kHz depth and a quick ascender that ranges from 3-6kHz (3kHz in depth), rising above the slurred whistle call which starts at 5kHz, and which seems to fade from 5-6kHz.
- **Depth**: Whistle depth is generally 1-2kHz.
- **Bandedness:** Single.
- **Frequency range:** Main whistle is from 4.5-6kHz, ascender from 3-6kHz.
- **Wavelength:** Each call is roughly 15mS.
- **Number of waves:** 3 calls.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.

##### Upland Sandpiper

This information is eye-balled from the one example in Pieplow (2017). More sample sizes and analysis would be beneficial.

- **Duration:** 30mS, with each of three calls taking roughly 8mS with a short gap in between.
- **Regularity:** Three calls. Middle note often highest.
- **Directionality:** Ascending. Short ascender (.5kHz depth), occasional short tail (1kHz depth).
- **Depth**: 4Khz in total, 1.5kHz for main band.
- **Bandedness:** Two or three bands, with one strong lowest band.
- **Frequency range:** 1.5kHz to 3.5kHz for main band, up to 5.5kHz for secondary band.
- **Wavelength:** -
- **Number of waves:** -
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.

##### Killdeer Dee-dit-dit

The _dee-dit-dit_ call is relatively easy to disambiguate; there's a long _deet_, followed by one to five notes, each shorter and lower than before. (Pieplow 2017)

- **Duration:** 1 second
- **Regularity:** One long call, then shorter calls.
- **Directionality:** Generally descending.
- **Depth**: 1-2kHz.
- **Bandedness:** Up to five bands, with the middle being the strongest.
- **Frequency range:** Main band from 4kHz to 6kHz, entire call from 2kHz to 7kHz.
- **Wavelength:** -
- **Number of waves:** -
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** An excitement call, probably not given in migration.
