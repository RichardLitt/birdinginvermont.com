The Solitary Sandpiper is a common shorebird in Vermont, both in the Champlain basin and further inland. It is also a commonly nocturnal migrant, being quite vocal in flight and easily identifiable as a peep species. Disambiguating it from [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa) is the main challenge for identifying this species. Many birds would be best left unidentified. Luckily, the night calls are almost identical to the day-time flight calls for this species.

### Published References

Pieplow (2017) notes one call given as an NFC: the _pwee-pwee-pwee_.

> Commonly heard from migrants. Given in alarm or upon flushing; also during nocturnal flight. Almost never more than three notes.

He notes an infrequently heard version on breeding grounds, where the notes are nearly monotone. This is useful, because the _pwee-pwee-pwee_ example he gives is not monotone - the notes have a depth from 4.5kHz to 6kHz, not including the ascenders going from 3-7kHz. The [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa) gives a more monotone call as it's _pee-pwee-pwee_ call, and lower, averaging around 4khz. He goes on:

> Series of 2-3 upslurred whistles... usually 3 notes, all on same pitch.

Sibley (2016) describes Solitary:

> Flight call a clear, high, rising whistle _peet weet weet_; higher and more urgent than [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa).

Birds of the World (Reed 2020) covers nocturnal flight calls in some depth:

> When flushed and in migratory flight, gives a 3-note _wheet-wheet-wheet_ call similar to that of [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa) but more evenly pitched (Paulson 1993). Call also similar to that of Green Sandpiper but softer (Webber 1968). When call has 3 syllables, bird is either leaving an area or briefly passing through; when 2 syllables, it is more likely simply changing position at existing site (Nichols 1920a). Nichols (Nichols 1920a) describes an unusual _kikikiki_ and also says there may be 2 types of _pip_ or _pit_ notes.

Clarfield has also heard Solitary described as "tinnier" or "hollower". (Clarfield, personal communications)

### Call Description

The _pwee-pwee-pwee_ call is identified as an NFC call by Pieplow (2017).  Note that this information has a sample size of 2. Call assessments eyeballed from Pieplow (2017).

- **Duration:** 60mS
- **Regularity:** Notes normally on same pitch, although last note can be shorter.
- **Directionality:** Ascending like an exponential curve, with a sharp tail of .5kHz depth and a quick ascender that ranges from 3-6kHz (3kHz in depth), rising above the slurred whistle call which starts at 5kHz, and which seems to fade from 5-6kHz.
- **Depth**: Whistle depth is generally 1-2kHz.
- **Bandedness:** Single.
- **Frequency range:** Main whistle is from 4.5-6kHz, ascender from 3-6kHz.
- **Wavelength:** Each call is roughly 15mS.
- **Number of waves:** 3 calls.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.

### Example Calls

A few good examples of the calls are [here](https://www.xeno-canto.org/489750) and [here](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/222003721).

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- 1kHz higher than [SPSA](./spsa) on average, several kHz higher than [UPSA](./upsa)
- Can go above 6kHz, while [SPSA](./spsa) doesn't (_needs confirmation_)
- Notes generally on the same pitch
- Almost never more than three notes
- Note ascenders and descenders for SOSA and not for [SPSA](./spsa)

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

Pieplow (2017) notes at the back that the Solitary Sandpiper has an upslurred call, where he lists [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa) as well as Baird's Sandpiper, Olive-sided Flycatcher, and Prothonotary Warbler song - all of which can be discarded as based on a typical Solitary Sandpiper call comparison by looking at the length of the calls, for Baird's, and the time of night and location, for the other two. This leaves the the Solitary Sandpiper as main contenders for confusion.

I think another confusing bird would be [Upland Sandpiper](./upsa), which has a similar, if lower, call. Green Sandpiper (Ã  la Webber 1968) isn't useful to go through, here, as it is unlikely to be recorded migrating in North America.

##### [Spotted Sandpiper](./spsa)

Call assessments eyeballed from Pieplow (2017). There are several different types of NFC call, also given diurnally. The _pee_ series are flat, or form small inverted u's, and are not easily confused. However, the _pee-pwee-pwee_ series is shaped similarly, with up-ticks. This is used for the information below. Note that this information has a sample size of 2.

- **Duration:** 20mS per call, 2-5 calls per second
- **Regularity:** The notes are slightly different. See below.
- **Directionality:** Short version has 2 upslurred notes, with the second slightly lower. The longer version has the first 1-3 notes shorter, higher, with the ascent looking like a hockey-stick and not consistent. Beginning notes tend to have a short quick ascent, of around .5kHz depth, and can have a short tail of around .3kHz depth.
- **Depth**: Whistle depth is generally 1-2kHz.
- **Bandedness:** Single.
- **Frequency range:** 3-5kHz.
- **Wavelength:** Not modulated.
- **Number of waves:** Not modulated.
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.

##### [Upland Sandpiper](./upsa)

This information is eye-balled from the one example in Pieplow (2017). More sample sizes and analysis would be beneficial.

- **Duration:** 30mS, with each of three calls taking roughly 8mS with a short gap in between.
- **Regularity:** Three calls. Middle note often highest.
- **Directionality:** Ascending. Short ascender (.5kHz depth), occasional short tail (1kHz depth).
- **Depth**: 4Khz in total, 1.5kHz for main band.
- **Bandedness:** Two or three bands, with one strong lowest band.
- **Frequency range:** 1.5kHz to 3.5kHz for main band, up to 5.5kHz for secondary band.
- **Wavelength:** -
- **Number of waves:** -
- **Diurnal and nocturnal call similarity:** Identical.
