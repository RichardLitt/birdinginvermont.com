The Ovenbird has a distinctive and common call for NFCers in Vermont.

### Published References

Evans (2002):

> An explosive, piercing, slightly rising "seet" with a faintly sibilant quality. Sometimes a more abrupt "pseek".

And:

> Primarily a nocturnal migrant but engages in limited redetermined migration. Gives flight call regularly while perched and in flight during the day, and during nocturnal migration. Gives flight song occasionally in nocturnal migration, particularly near breeding habitat.

Pieplow (2017):

> Sreet ... rising, mostly clear. ... All year, often by night migrants. Some versions grade intwo Tsweet

Stephenson and Whittle (2013) note:

> Clear: long, high, a bit shrill; more Complex toward end; distinctive.

And

> Rising, long high, shrill

Dunn and Garrett (1997):

> Flight note, not often heard, is a thin, high _seee_.

Curson et al. (1994) note "a thin, high-pitched 'seee,' given in flight."

Birds of the World (Porneluzi et al. 2020) mentions many Ovenbird calls, but doesn't distinguish any of them as the flight call, much less the nocturnal flight call.

### Salient Points

_This section may not be helpful. The idea is to make it easier to rule out other species more easily without going through the whole list, which may not be possible._

- **Tadpole** shape.

### Similar species

The following species were noted as being similar by the cited experts. Any notes underneath the species can be used to rule out the other species for particular calls.

When describing this call in comments on an NFC checklist, try and add as many salient notes as possible and refer to this page for justification. If there are any species which seem similar, please get in touch so we can add them here. The intent here is to have a full list of differences for each possible similar call.

All notes for species are coming from Evans (2002), unless where noted.

Evans (2002)

> Blue-winged and Golden-winged Warblers are less piercing and often buzzier. Yellow-rumped Warbler is typically lower. Vesper and White-crowned Sparrows are typically longer. See Prothonotary and Swainson's Warblers and short rising seeps.

Pieplow (2017) notes that these birds give _Sreet_ calls: Tennessee Warbler, Orange-crowned Warbler, Nashville Warbler, Black-throated Green Warbler, Golden-cheeked Warbler, Clay-colored Sparrow, Brewer's Sparrow. Slightly longer are the Prothonotary Warbler, Swainson's Warbler, Vesper Sparrow, White-crowned Sparrow. "Sometimes slightly buzzy" is where he puts the Ovenbird, along with the Blue- and Golden-winged Warbler, although he notes that it is like the _Dzit_, where he gives 20 birds, which calque onto what Evans (2002) calls the "tseet" complex. Mourning Warbler ("sometimes slightly less buzzy"), and Yellow-rumped Warblers and noted as being slightly lower.

It seems pertinent to review at least the union of these two sets of comparisons, then.

- Black-throated Blue: Lacks modulation, and distinctly rises with a small squiggle in the middle.
- Black-throated Green Warbler: Double banded, lacks modulation.
- Blue-winged Warbler
- Brewer's Sparrow
- Clay-colored Sparrow: Lacks modulation, ascending portion steeper than Ovenbirds.
- Golden-cheeked Warbler: Lightly double-banded, lacks modulation.
- Golden-winged Warbler
- Mourning Warbler: Double-banded, slow modulations (5.6mS) with ...
- Nashville: Double-banded, evenly rising, lacks, modulation bandwidth smaller.
- Orange-crowned Warbler: Double-banded, lacks modulation.
- Prothonotary Warbler
- Swainson's Warbler
- Tennessee Warbler: Double-banded, lacks modulation.
- Vesper Sparrow
- White-crowned Sparrow
- Yellow-rumped Warbler: Rises,then descends. Double-banded. Modulation depth much smaller, if present at all.
