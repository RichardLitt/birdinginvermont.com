HORE	Hoary Redpoll	Acanthis hornemanni	A.h.h., A.h.exilipes	Hoary Redpoll (exilipes), Hoary Redpoll (hornemanni)	A.h.h., A.h.e.	2	2	0	1e,2h	0	Ssp.	Ssp.	Media	More hornemanni audio	Hornemanni: Larger and generally paler and brighter than low-arctic exilipes. Largest of all redpolls: about 10% larger than most exilipes, and slightly larger than A. f. rostrata. Compared to A. h. exilipes, adult male A. h. hornemanni sometimes appears longer-tailed and thicker-necked. Bill thicker and longer, but feathering at base of bill dense and size not always apparent; dense feathering probably contributes to steeper forehead; head and neck generally more massive and bird often “front-heavy.” Tibia heavily feathered but also on many A. h. exilipes . Adult male A. h. hornemanni whiter-faced, with brighter supercilium and sides of head; upperparts with very broad white feather edges and dark centers, often making feathers appear striped black and white; white area on rump larger; breast pale frosty or salmon pink; underparts whiter and less streaked; edges to wing- and tail feathers (including wing-bars) broader and paler. Adult female like male, but almost or completely lacking pink on face, breast, and rump, and face and breast in particular more buff, and flanks usually more streaked. First-year individuals similarly duller and more streaked. (See Czaplak 1995 for further details.)			https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/hoared/cur/systematics

P. i. iliaca can be distinguished from all subspecies in schistacea group by different proportions in wing and tail lengths (wing longer than tail in iliaca, wing equal to or shorter than tail in schistacea group) and overall bright-ruddy plumage coloration. The much brighter hue of reddish markings, sharply contrasting red-and-gray dorsal streaking, and heavier and more stubby bill distinguish iliaca from all subspecies within unalaschcensis group. P. i. iliaca distinguished from altivagans by greater general size and brighter, more ruddy coloration, with more sharply defined dorsal streaking (Swarth 1920b).			https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/foxspa/cur/systematics
