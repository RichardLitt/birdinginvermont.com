Can we submit a complete checklist in every town in Vermont this year? 2021 was the first year where every town, gore, and grant was birded in - hopefully we can do the same again in 2022!

To participate, share a minimum 5-minute long, [complete checklist](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748) with the eBird account **vermont251**.

Why are there **green** towns? Those are towns which people birded in without a high carbon cost! If you bird at home, or if you bike, walk, canoe, hitch-hike, or otherwise spend no carbon costs going to another town, [send me an email](mailto:richard@birdinginvermont.com) saying which town you'd like to turn green. Hopefully we can bird responsibly and still fill out this map!
