title: 'Project 251'

Can we submit a complete checklist in every town in Vermont this year? 2021 was the first year where every town, gore, and grant was birded in - hopefully we can do the same again in 2022!

To participate, share a minimum 5-minute long, [complete checklist](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748) with the eBird account **vermont251**.
