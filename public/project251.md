title: 'Project 251'

This year, I am challenging Vermonters to collaboratively bird in each of our 251 towns.

To join in, simply share any [complete checklist](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000967748) from any town with the eBird account **vermont251**.

I will update this map every week, to show what new towns should be added, or what new species have been seen in those towns from the shared checklists. If you bird in a new town, or see a bird in a town that isn't listed here, share your checklists!
