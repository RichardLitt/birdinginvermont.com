# Female Birdsongs

Female birds, as well as males, occasionally sing their species song. However, birders rarely identify females singing, and often assume that all singers are male. This isn't true!

The [Female Birdsong project](http://femalebirdsong.org/) is creating a resource about female birdsongs.  On their website, you can [track contributions](http://femalebirdsong.org/trackcontribution/) and download a list of [target species](http://femalebirdsong.org/targetspecies/). Currently, none of their contributions show female birdsongs in Vermont.

[Bridget Butler](https://www.birddiva.com/) is hoping to change that. She's made a list of all of the birds in Vermont for which we need female bird songs, and is actively curating it.

We plan to add that list of birds, here. For now, **if you note a female bird singing, upload it to eBird or Xeno-canto and let us know!**

<!-- Notes

Breeding Birds of Vermont notes that WTSP bright females sing more than dull males; how do they know?
